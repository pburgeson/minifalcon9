# Mini Falcon 9
This is a project inspired by SpaceX and my interest in control systems.  The ability to launch and land a rocket vertically is absolutely stunning to me.  I believe there is no better way to learn about the challenges and solutions to a problem than to try it out for yourself.  My goal is not create new things but rather to explore the wonder of rockets and control systems.  

# Project Scope
This project will happen in several major pieces:
* Creation of a throttlable rocket engine at the model rocket scale
* Design and construction of rocket with thrust vectoring system at the model scale.
* Development and implementation of control system for stable flight and propulsive landing

# Project Challenges
**Rocketry** - At the outset of this project, I know almost nothing about rocketry other than what a background in engineering affords.  There will be a significant learning curve as I will likely be designing and building a small rocket engine.  
**Safety** - Rockets are dangerous.  
**Control System** - This will be the most complex control system I've implemented and the control system has limited control authority.  I may experiment with a neural network  depending on how non-linear the system is.  

# Project Roadmap
Since this is a large project and I am one person, I will be splitting the project up into smaller pieces.
1. Flight of a non-kit model rocket with data logging and telemetry (development in progress)
2. Flight of model rocket with Thrust Vector Control (not yet started)
3. Development and testing of liquid rocket engine at model scale (not yet started)
4. Integration of final flight vehicle (not yet started)

# Project Updates
Updates will be done via the project wiki.  I will (hopefully) be keeping a design journal there.
