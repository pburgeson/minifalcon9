# Mini Falcon 9
This is a project inspired by SpaceX and my interest in control systems.  The ability to launch and land a rocket vertically is absolutely stunning to me.  I believe there is no better way to learn about the challenges and solutions to a problem than to try it out for yourself.  My goal is not create new things but rather to explore the wonder of rockets and control systems.  

# Project Scope
This project will happen in several major stages:
* Creation of a throttlable rocket engine at the model rocket scale
* Design and construction of rocket with thrust vectoring system at the rocket scale.
* Development and implementation of control system for stable flight and propulsive landing

# Project Challenges
**Rocketry** - At the outset of this project, I know almost nothing about rocketry other than what a background in engineering affords.  There will be a significant learning curve as I will likely be designing and building a small rocket engine.  
**Safety** - Rockets are dangerous.  
**Control System** - This will be the most complex control system I've implemented and the control system has limited control authority.  I may experiment with a neural network like the RL Pendulum depending on how non-linear the system is.
